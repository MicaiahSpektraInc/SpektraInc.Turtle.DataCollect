# Turtle Data Collector 

#The project receives data and then outputs it as a bar graph.

The project is built to be a data organiser used to organise set data --Name, age, role, sex and hair colour-- which outputs it using Turtle which is a pre-installed Python library to create a bar graph.


The User inputs the data (Name, age, role, sex, and hair colour) in the front end which organizes the data in their dedicated variables. 

The data is then transferred to the data backend by importing the frontend data which then gets organized and counted by the data backend using a count function.

The front end collects the values from the data backend which is then imported by the turtle backend.

The turtle backend uses its functions to create an appropriate graph with colour codes to output the numeric data that is received from the front end.
